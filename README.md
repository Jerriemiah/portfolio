## Projects  

## IT Support & Systems Projects {#it-support-systems-projects}

### [Enterprise Office Network Expansion & Inter-Building Connectivity](https://github.com/Jerriemiah/network-optimization/blob/main/README.md)

**Problem**  
A newly constructed large office building required full network connectivity and seamless integration with an existing enterprise network, under a strict delivery timeline.

**Approach**  
Supported the deployment of fiber connectivity between buildings, enterprise switching and routing, and large-scale wireless infrastructure. Coordinated structured cabling with building contractors and validated wired and wireless access across all areas.

**Outcome**  
Successfully connected the new building to the existing network, delivered full wireless and wired access, and completed the project **ahead of schedule (12 days vs. planned 20 days)** with minimal disruption to operations.

**Skills:** Enterprise networking, fiber connectivity, wireless infrastructure, infrastructure deployment, cross-team coordination

### [IT Infrastructure & System Configuration Overhaul](https://github.com/Jerriemiah/it-infrastructure-overhaul/blob/main/README.md)

**Problem**  
Inconsistent workstation and peripheral setups led to recurring support issues, performance degradation, and downtime.

**Approach**  
Supported structured setup and configuration of desktops, printers, and network devices, with emphasis on standardization, repeatable installation steps, and clear documentation.

**Outcome**  
Improved system reliability, reduced repeat configuration issues, and strengthened operational consistency through standardized processes.

**Skills:** System administration, troubleshooting, documentation, IT operations

### [Customer Support & Managed Network Service Improvement](https://github.com/Jerriemiah/managed-network-support-process-improvement/blob/main/README.md)

**Problem**  
Manual incident logging and inconsistent escalation processes led to slow response times and limited visibility for managed network support operations.

**Approach**  
Implemented Freshdesk as a centralized ticketing system, introduced ticket categorization and prioritization, automated responses for common issues, and defined clear escalation workflows for critical incidents.

**Outcome**  
Reduced average response time by approximately **40%**, improved communication with supported sites during outages, and increased overall support efficiency.

**Skills:** IT support operations, incident management, escalation workflows, customer communication, process improvement

## Cloud & DevOps Learning Projects {#cloud-devops-learning-projects}

> These projects were completed as part of structured training and internship stages to build foundational understanding of cloud infrastructure, deployment reliability, and DevOps workflows.

---

### [Linux Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Simulation — vpcctl](https://github.com/Jerriemiah/vpcctl/blob/main/README.md)

**Problem**  
Cloud networking concepts such as VPCs, subnets, routing, NAT, and isolation are often abstracted by providers, making it difficult to understand how they work internally.

**Approach**  
Built a custom CLI tool (`vpcctl`) to recreate VPC behavior from first principles using Linux network namespaces, bridges, veth pairs, routing tables, and iptables. Implemented multiple VPCs, subnet isolation, optional peering, firewall rules, and lifecycle cleanup.

**Outcome**  
Developed a deep, practical understanding of cloud networking internals, Linux isolation, routing behavior, and infrastructure lifecycle management.

**Stack:** Linux, Bash, Python, iproute2, iptables  
**Concepts:** Networking fundamentals, isolation, routing, firewalling, VPC design

### [Blue/Green Deployment with Observability & Auto-Failover](https://github.com/Jerriemiah/hng-stage2-bluegreen/blob/main/README.md)

**Problem**  
Service updates and failures can cause downtime and poor user experience without proper deployment strategies and monitoring.

**Approach**  
Implemented a Blue/Green deployment architecture using Docker Compose and NGINX upstreams, ensuring zero-downtime failover. Extended the system with structured NGINX logging and a Python-based log watcher that detects failovers and error-rate spikes, sending alerts to Slack.

**Outcome**  
Achieved zero failed client requests during simulated outages, gained hands-on experience with high-availability patterns, and implemented operational visibility through automated alerts and runbooks.

**Stack:** Docker Compose, NGINX, Python  
**Concepts:** High availability, deployment strategies, failover, observability, alerting

### [Automated Deployment Bash Script](https://github.com/Jerriemiah/hng-stage1-devops-deploy/blob/main/README.md)

**Problem**  
Manual server setup and application deployment were repetitive, error-prone, and difficult to reproduce reliably.

**Approach**  
Developed a single executable Bash script to automate remote environment preparation, Dockerized application deployment, NGINX reverse proxy configuration, validation, logging, and safe re-runs.

**Outcome**  
Reduced manual deployment effort, improved consistency across environments, and reinforced core DevOps automation and scripting practices.

**Stack:** Bash, Docker, NGINX  
**Concepts:** Automation, scripting fundamentals, remote deployment
