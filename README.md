## Projects  

## IT Support & Systems Projects {#it-support-systems-projects}

### [Enterprise Office Network Expansion & Inter-Building Connectivity](https://github.com/Jerriemiah/network-optimization/blob/main/README.md)

**Problem**  
A newly constructed large office building required full network connectivity and seamless integration with an existing enterprise network, under a strict delivery timeline.

**Approach**  
Supported the deployment of fiber connectivity between buildings, enterprise switching and routing, and large-scale wireless infrastructure. Coordinated structured cabling with building contractors and validated wired and wireless access across all areas.

**Outcome**  
Successfully connected the new building to the existing network, delivered full wireless and wired access, and completed the project **ahead of schedule (12 days vs. planned 20 days)** with minimal disruption to operations.

**Skills:** Enterprise networking, fiber connectivity, wireless infrastructure, infrastructure deployment, cross-team coordination

### [IT Infrastructure & System Configuration Overhaul](https://github.com/Jerriemiah/it-infrastructure-overhaul/blob/main/README.md)

**Problem**  
Inconsistent workstation and peripheral setups led to recurring support issues, performance degradation, and downtime.

**Approach**  
Supported structured setup and configuration of desktops, printers, and network devices, with emphasis on standardization, repeatable installation steps, and clear documentation.

**Outcome**  
Improved system reliability, reduced repeat configuration issues, and strengthened operational consistency through standardized processes.

**Skills:** System administration, troubleshooting, documentation, IT operations

### [Customer Support & Managed Network Service Improvement](https://github.com/Jerriemiah/managed-network-support-process-improvement/blob/main/README.md)

**Problem**  
Manual incident logging and inconsistent escalation processes led to slow response times and limited visibility for managed network support operations.

**Approach**  
Implemented Freshdesk as a centralized ticketing system, introduced ticket categorization and prioritization, automated responses for common issues, and defined clear escalation workflows for critical incidents.

**Outcome**  
Reduced average response time by approximately **40%**, improved communication with supported sites during outages, and increased overall support efficiency.

**Skills:** IT support operations, incident management, escalation workflows, customer communication, process improvement

## Cloud & DevOps Learning Projects {#cloud-devops-learning-projects}

> These projects were completed as part of structured training and internship stages to build foundational understanding of cloud and DevOps concepts.

### [Automated Deployment Script](#)
**Problem**  
Manual environment setup was time-consuming and error-prone.

**Approach**  
Created a Bash-based deployment script to provision environments and deploy containers with repeatable steps.

**Outcome**  
Reduced manual setup effort and improved consistency across deployments.

**Stack:** Bash, Docker, NGINX  
**Concepts:** Automation, scripting fundamentals

### [Blue / Green Deployment Simulation](#)
**Problem**  
Service updates caused downtime during restarts.

**Approach**  
Implemented dual-environment routing using Docker Compose and NGINX.

**Outcome**  
Enabled zero-downtime deployment simulations and safe rollback testing.

**Stack:** Docker Compose, NGINX  
**Concepts:** High availability, deployment strategies

### [Observability & Log Monitoring](https://github.com/Jerriemiah/hng13-stage0-devops)
**Problem**  
Service failures were not immediately visible.

**Approach**  
Built a basic log watcher that sends alerts to Slack based on defined conditions.

**Outcome**  
Improved incident visibility and understanding of monitoring workflows.

**Stack:** Python, NGINX  
**Concepts:** Logging, alerting fundamentals

### [Linux Virtual Network Simulation](https://github.com/Jerriemiah/vpcctl)
**Problem**  
Needed practical understanding of cloud-style networking concepts.

**Approach**  
Simulated VPC-like networking using Linux namespaces, routing, and iptables.

**Outcome**  
Gained hands-on exposure to low-level networking and isolation concepts.

**Stack:** Linux, Bash, Python  
**Concepts:** Networking fundamentals, routing, isolation
